/*
plan for now:
- implement classes for the lobby
- when running main user will be promoted with options (for now only resturant)
- when they select resturant they will get options thrown at them
    - create a list of some options
- they can enter l or r to simulate the swipe
- when finishing all the options well return the options they liked
 */
