User Restaurant Lobby Like/Dislike <-- i can like something one day and dislike the next

userId, restId, lobbyId, LIKE/DISLIKE

Map<UserId, <Map<RestId, Map<LobbyId, Like/Dislike>>>> ~ multimap
Map<Triple, Decision>
userId:restId:lobbyId, Like/Dislike

use interfaces for stores to make switching out from hashmap to postgres easier

user creates a lobby --> database action to create
users join that lobby --> database action to add
"game" is started, users presented with options --> "algo" to present all users with same recs
users like/dislike options --> these are stored in a store somewhere (map or database, etc)
"game" is ended, users presented with the final counts --> get from store and piece it together / sort if needed
