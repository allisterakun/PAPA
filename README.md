# PAPA
Team Papa John's: Amy, Paul, Allister, Philip

Description:
Design and build a web app (or mobile app) which will assist users with difficult decisions they need to make, such as deciding on a place to eat, games to play, vacation spots, etc. Users will be able to create a lobby or link/code that they can share with their peers in which people will swipe left or right on the particular choices. Once all the users have swiped through all the options, the app will return a list of the top X choices that everyone matched with.

Minimum Viable Product:
- Users can create accounts and log in and out of the website/app
- Users can navigate from the home page to their profile or to their next search
- Users can search for different topics that they may need to make a decision for (books to  read, vacation spots, places to eat)
- Users can decide to swipe left and right on different things our database recommends
- Make a lobby with other users - enter lobby with code - person
  - Note: do not need to make an account or log in if someone has given you a lobby code; only need to log in if you’re making the lobby
- Leader of lobby can confirm others’ requests to join
- Database keeps tab of previous swipes and uses it to recommend next items
- Custom user generated list option
- Focus on 1 or 2 categories; decide on which specific categories later 
- Add filters
  - Example filters for restaurant category: Price ranges, Location/distances, and types, fancy/casual, sit-down/fast-food, etc.
  - Example filters for movie category: length, reviews, type, release date, mood, etc.
- Recommendations will be tracked on a per-user level and will be saved to your profile. Group recommendations will include a pool from everyone’s profile.
